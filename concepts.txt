stack guessed words after successful submission
after each successful guess submission comes the current guess row
after that guess row comes 6 - 1 current guess row - n guessed word rows = number of rows that represent future guesses

guessed word rows are static
future guess rows are static
only thing that updates is current guess row
a key down event listener is attached to this row and only alphabetic characters are captured
guesses can only be 5 letters long - after the fifth letter entered, user's key presses are not captured in guess unless user presses backspace
when user presses enter this submits a guess
if guess submission is successful, guessed words stack has another guess pushed onto it and current guess row is reset
if guess submission is not successful, user is notified guess was not successful and current guess row is not reset

guess submission is not successful when user tries to submit a word:
1. without enough letters, or
2. not in word bank
submissions are still allowed in these cases

guess submission is successful, check which letters are in actual selected word
if a letter is in the word and in the correct space, return 2
if a letter is in the word and not in the correct space, return 1
if a letter is not in the word, return 0
return an array of these numbers in the associated position of each respective letter
server also returns a property which states whether user has won game

a successful guess wins the game
successful guess is determined server side by summing total of guess array. does it equal 10?
when successful guess notification is received in returned data, user can no longer interact with game board

after 6 attempts with 0 successful guesses, player loses game
